## Short description

### What's the problem?

Cars are spewing out up to 306,000 extra tons of carbon dioxide per year because their tires are under-inflated. These emissions directly contribute to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Reducing pollution by keeping ones tires at the proper pressure is a crucial step towards sustaining the fuel economy.

### How can technology help?

Technology can facilitate solve the problem of lack of Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems in India. Data-driven Machine Learning and Image Recognition approaches can be used to analyze historical data and estimate the tire pressures in our vehicles.

### The idea

We present a new AI based mobile application that utilizes the mobile camera to estimate the tire pressure and predicts the percentage drop in fuel efficiency if the vehicle is driven with the current state of the tires.


## Demo video

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Long description

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
